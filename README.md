# IOS-Portfolio-Nandhiyar22
Hi My name is Adhava Nandhiyar and this is my portfolio. I have taken classes AP Computer Science and AP Java and now IOS so I believe I have some coding experience. I had trouble figuring what app I wanted to make during the entirety of third term so I was mostly doing coding tutorials and improving asset making this term instead of an actual personal app. I finally figured out what I want to do so I am just making assets for it and figuring out the proper code for it but I am also working on a team app;
