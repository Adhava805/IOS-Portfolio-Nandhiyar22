# IOS-Portfolio-Nandhiyar22
Hi My name is Adhava Nandhiyar and I am a junior at Eden Prairie High School. I have taken classes AP Computer Science and AP Java and now IOS so I believe I have some coding experience. I had trouble figuring what app I wanted to make during the entirety of third term so I was mostly doing coding tutorials this term instead of an actual personal app. I finally figured out what I want to do so I am just making assets for it and figuring out the proper code for it but I am also working on a team app.
