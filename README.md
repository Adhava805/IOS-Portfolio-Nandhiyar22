# IOS-Portfolio-Nandhiyar22
Hi My name is Adhava Nandhiyar and this is my portfolio. I have taken classes AP Computer Science and AP Java and now IOS so I believe I have some coding experience. I had trouble figuring what app I wanted to make during the entirety of third term so I was mostly doing coding tutorials and improving asset making this term instead of an actual personal app. I finally figured out what I want to do so I am just making assets for it and figuring out the proper code for it but I am also working on a team app, This term I tried focusing on my personal app but i kept coming up short on the code and not being familiar with spritekit and scene so i couldn't get it properly functioning. I also wanted to help with our class project so i wanted to work on the database but the code was confusing so i couldn't do that. So i worked on our team app and i did coding for it like making the enemies spawns, shooting projectiles, and collisons detection.
